  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  The project I have created  is a README generator. This project enables users to generate a README simply with the use of command line, without using the regular option of a markdown.
  This project was created to enable users create a readme without browser javascript. Also, this project was created to ensure that users gave a proper summary and detailed information about a certain project.
  This README generator will allow  users to answer a series of specific questions which in turn will create a professional  README based on their responses. In return, users will have a descriptive and informative project.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
  Please use the link below to view installation guidew. With this readme, users can now  download  and copy the filet to a directory of their choice. They can also decide to clone the code with their IDE  terminal by writing 'git clone'. Open the file in VS Code or IDE of your choice. Once the terminal is open, users can navigate to the root folder 'readme-generator', and run the app.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
  After installation is complete, run the following code: ‘node inex.js’ in the terminal. Answer the prompts and after questions have been answered, users can see a console log showing their answers to their prompts, with  a messages ‘File created!'. The file should be situated within the  ‘develop’ folder called ‘README.md’. It’s generated in mark down syntax.
