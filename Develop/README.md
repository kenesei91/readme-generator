  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
   My project is a README generator. This project enables users to generate a README simply with the use of command line, without the application of proper markdown.
  This project was created to enable users create a readme without browser javascript. Also, this project was created to ensure that users gave a proper summary and detailed information about a certain project.
  This README generator will allow the user to answer a series of specific questions and create a professional complete README based on their responses. In return, users will have a descriptive and informative project.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
  A repository link has been provided  below. Users can download the zip file and copy it to a directory of your choice or clone to a directory of your choice using your terminal. Open the file in VS Code or IDE of your choiceh. Once the terminal is open, navigste to the root folder 'readme-generator', and run the app.

  ## [Usage](#table-of-contents)
  After installation is complete, run the following code: ‘node inex.js’ in the terminal. Answer the prompts and after completion, you should see a console log showing your answers to your prompts, a message that says ‘File created!’, and you should see your file under the ‘develop’ folder called ‘README.md’. From here you can copy and npaste the markdown syntax for your use.
